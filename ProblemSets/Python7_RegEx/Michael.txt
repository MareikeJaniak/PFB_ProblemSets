Michael by Shel Silverstein

Michael loves me,
Michael cares,
Michael picks me peaches and pears.
Michael offers me candy and Cokes,
Michael listens and laughs at me jokes.
Michael helps when I get in a fight,
Michael does all my homework at night.
Michael misses me,
Michael cries,
Michael thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Michael is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Michael just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Michael's hand,
In the darkness where Michael usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Michael's gone!
